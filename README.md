📌 Task-4: Recommendation System
📖 Description

This project implements a Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering.
The system suggests items to users based on the preferences of similar users, calculated using Cosine Similarity.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook)

📂 Dataset

A custom user–item rating dataset was created, where users rate different items.
This dataset is used to learn user preferences and generate recommendations.

⚙️ Implementation Steps

Created a user–item rating dataset

Converted the dataset into a user–item matrix

Calculated cosine similarity between users

Identified users with similar preferences

Recommended items liked by similar users that the target user has not interacted with

📊 Results

The system successfully generated personalized recommendations

Recommendations are based on similarity scores between users

Demonstrates the working of collaborative filtering
